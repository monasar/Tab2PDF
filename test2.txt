                       F                       C
Well you only need the light when it s burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know your love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
              G                        Am
Only hate the road when you re missin  home
               F                         C
Only know your love her when you ve let her go
G
  And you let her go



Am   F   G   Em
Am   F   G



Am                            F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        G                            Em
Hoping one day you will make a dream last
               Am               F          G
The dreams come slow and goes so fast
    Am                          F
You see her when you close your eyes
      G                           Em
Maybe one day you will understand why
               Am           F         G
Everything you touch surely dies



                       F                       C
Well you only need the light when it s burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know your love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
              G                        Am
Only hate the road when you re missin  home
               F                         C
Only know your love her when you ve let her go




Am                            F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
         G                     Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
           Am                 F       G
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      F
Well you see her when you fall asleep
                G                  Em
But to never to touch and never to keep
                         Am
Because you loved her to much
                 F          G
And you dive too deep





                       F                       C
Well you only need the light when it s burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know your love her when you let her go
                      F                        C
Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
              G                        Am
Only hate the road when you re missin  home
               F                         C
Only know your love her when you ve let her go


                Am
And you let her go
